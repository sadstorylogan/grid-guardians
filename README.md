## High Concept
Grid Guardians is a militaristic turned-based tactical shooter with low-poly visuals. Players must succeed through the missions to finish the game.

### Player's Objective
The primary objective for the player is to strategically maneuver their squad of Grid Guardians to eliminate the terrorist threat in each mission while achieving mission-specific goals. These goals range from defending a base, rescuing civilians, or retrieving vital intel.

### Movement & Positioning
- **Grid-Based Movement**: The battlefield is divided into a grid. Each unit has a specific number of tiles they can move each turn.
- **Cover System**: Various objects on the battlefield (like walls, cars, and barricades) can be used as cover. Units in cover receive a defense bonus, making them harder to hit or damage.
- **High Ground Advantage**: Units positioned on elevated terrain have increased sight and range, allowing them to target enemies from a distance and potentially deal more damage.
